# PR & Branch Workflow

- Always use Graphite (`gt submit`) for PRs, never `gh pr create`
- Leave PRs in draft unless user explicitly asks to mark ready
- Never close/delete PRs to fix mistakes — update in place
- Never force push unless user explicitly requests it
- Prefer additive fixes over destructive ones on shared resources
- Use `/submit` skill for all PR operations
