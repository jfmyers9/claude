# Global Instructions

- I use git-town for branch management
- Use `/ship` to sync and create PRs
- Use `/commit` for conventional commits

## Documentation and Notes

When writing documentation (either through skills or user request), save it to the `.jim` directory structure unless otherwise specified:

- `.jim-plans/` - Feature planning and exploration documents
- `.jim-notes/` - Personal notes and observations
- `.jim-scratch/` - Temporary working files
- `.jim-state/` - State tracking files

These directories are git-ignored and meant for local, personal documentation that supports your development workflow.
