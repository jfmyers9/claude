# Implement

Implement the latest approved blueprint, sequentially and directly in
the current session. Blueprints are the only work tracker.

@rules/blueprints.md and @rules/harness-compat.md apply.

## Arguments

- `[blueprint-slug-or-path]` — optional spec/plan/review blueprint
- `--no-report` — skip automatic report generation

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve Blueprint

- If an explicit file path exists, use it.
- Else if an argument remains, run:
  `blueprint find --type plan,spec,review --match <arg>`
- Else run: `blueprint find --type plan,spec,review`
- Select the most recent file whose status is not `complete`.
- If none exists, stop and suggest `/skill:research`.

Read the file and skip YAML frontmatter. Prefer an `approved` plan, but
allow `plan_review` or `draft` when the user explicitly requested the
file/slug.

### 2. Parse Plan

Parse phases from the blueprint body:

- `**Phase N: ...**`
- `### Phase N: ...`
- `## Phase N: ...`

If no phases exist, treat the entire `## Plan`, `## Feedback Analysis`,
or `## Findings` section as one phase.

Each phase should produce:

- phase title
- referenced files
- required changes
- verification command/check

### 3. Implement Phases

For each phase, in order:

1. Read referenced files first.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the phase.
3. Stay within files named or clearly implied by the blueprint.
4. Run the phase verification if specified.
5. If no verification is specified, run the smallest relevant test,
   typecheck, lint, or smoke command available.
6. Append/update an `## Implementation Notes` section in the blueprint:
   ```markdown
   ### Phase N: <title>
   - Status: complete | blocked
   - Files changed: <paths>
   - Verification: <command> — <result>
   - Notes: <deviations or blockers>
   ```
7. Run `blueprint commit <type> <slug>` after the blueprint write.

If a phase is blocked, stop after recording the blocker.

### 4. Complete Blueprint

When all phases are complete:

```bash
blueprint status "$file" complete
blueprint commit <type> <slug>
```

Unless `--no-report` was passed, read `skills/report/SKILL.md` and
follow it to create a report blueprint.

### 5. Report

Show:

- blueprint path
- phases completed / blocked
- files changed
- verification commands and results
- next step: `/skill:review`, `/skill:commit`, or blocker details

## Rules

- Do not create separate task state.
- Do not spawn subagents or teams.
- Prefer vertical, testable changes.
- Preserve user changes; inspect `git status` before large edits.
