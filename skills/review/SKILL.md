# Review

Review introduced code and write findings to a `review/` blueprint.
Blueprints are the only review tracker.

@rules/blueprints.md and @rules/harness-compat.md apply.

## Arguments

- `<file-pattern>` — optional changed-file filter
- `<branch|PR>` — optional branch or PR number
- `--local` — review staged/unstaged local changes instead of a branch
- `--continue [slug]` — continue latest or matching review blueprint

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve Target

- Numeric arg: resolve branch with
  `gh pr view <N> --json headRefName -q .headRefName`, then review
  that branch.
- Branch arg: checkout only if explicitly requested.
- `--local`: review staged/unstaged local changes.
- Empty: review current branch. If current branch is `main`/`master`
  and local staged/unstaged changes exist, review those local changes.
  If no local changes exist on `main`/`master`, stop unless files were
  explicitly supplied.

Set:

```bash
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
trunk=$(gt trunk 2>/dev/null || echo main)
review_target=branch
if [ "$branch" = "main" ] || [ "$branch" = "master" ] || [ "${LOCAL_CHANGES:-0}" = 1 ]; then
  if ! git diff --quiet || ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
    review_target=local
  fi
fi
```

### 2. Gather Context

Run targeted commands:

```bash
if [ "$review_target" = local ]; then
  git diff --name-only
  git diff --cached --name-only
  git diff
  git diff --cached
else
  git log --oneline "$trunk"..HEAD
  git diff "$trunk"...HEAD --name-only
  git diff "$trunk"...HEAD
fi
gh pr view --json title,body,labels,reviewDecision 2>/dev/null || true
```

For local-change reviews, treat unstaged and staged diffs as introduced code.
If a file has both staged and unstaged hunks, review both and identify
which finding comes from which diff only when that distinction matters.
Untracked files are reviewed only when explicitly named by file-pattern.

Apply file-pattern filters if provided. Exclude lock files, generated
artifacts, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, and binaries unless they are
the focus.

Large diffs: for files with >200 diff lines, keep first 50 and last 50
lines in prompt context, then read full files only when needed.

### 3. Detect Context

Language reviewer:

- `.go` -> go
- `.ts` / `.tsx` -> typescript
- `.py` -> python
- `.rs` -> rust

Plan coherence:

```bash
branch_slug=$(blueprint slug "$branch")
if [ "$review_target" != local ]; then
  plan_file=$(blueprint find --type spec,plan --match "$branch_slug")
fi
```

If found, read `## Spec` and compare the diff against it.

### 4. Review Perspectives

Run each perspective sequentially in this session:

- Architect
- Code Quality
- Devil's Advocate
- Operations
- Test Quality
- Language-specific reviewer, if detected
- Design Coherence, if a source spec exists

Perspective prompts live in `skills/review/perspectives/*.md`. Read each
prompt and apply it to the gathered raw diff/context. If prompt files are
unavailable, use the perspective names above as lenses.

For every potential finding, verify against source before keeping it:

1. Read `file:line` ± 20 lines.
2. Check whether the issue is handled nearby or by callers/callees.
3. Check whether it is introduced by this branch.
4. For async/concurrent/state-machine findings, trace the full path.

Remove false positives aggressively. Keep uncertain items only with
`[needs-review]`.

### 5. Aggregate Findings

Build one unified findings document:

```markdown
## Reviewer Summaries
- Architect: ...
- Code Quality: ...
- Devil's Advocate: ...
- Operations: ...
- Test Quality: ...

## Approach Assessment
Sound | Minor Concerns | Significant Concerns | Alternative Recommended

## Verification Summary
Verified N findings: K confirmed, M false positives pruned, J
pre-existing removed/downgraded, L uncertain.

## Consensus Findings
<findings raised by 2+ perspectives>

## Phase 1: Critical Issues
<confirmed critical findings>

## Phase 2: Design Improvements
<confirmed design/code/ops improvements>

## Phase 3: Testing Gaps
<missing tests, each with concrete setup/action/assertion>

## Reply Notes
<optional notes for PR responses>
```

Skip empty sections. Group duplicate findings by root cause.

### 6. Store Review Blueprint

```bash
if [ "$review_target" = local ]; then
  file=$(blueprint create review "Review: local changes" --status draft --branch "$branch")
else
  file=$(blueprint create review "Review: $branch" --status draft --branch "$branch")
fi
```

If a source plan/spec was found:

```bash
SOURCE_SLUG=$(basename "$plan_file" .md)
blueprint link "$file" "$SOURCE_SLUG"
```

Write the findings body, then:

```bash
blueprint commit review <slug>
```

If commit fails, stop and show the error.

### 7. Report

```text
Review: <path>
Assessment: <rating>
Findings: <critical/improvement/testing counts>
Next: /skill:fix for actionable findings, or /skill:commit if clean
```

## Rules

- Review introduced code first.
- Only flag pre-existing code when it is critical and newly relevant.
- Always verify findings against source before output.
- Do not create native task state.
- Do not spawn subagents or teams.
