# Research

Research a topic, write a `spec/` blueprint, then use that blueprint
as the durable source of truth for implementation.

@rules/blueprints.md and @rules/harness-compat.md apply.

## Arguments

- `<topic>` — new research topic
- `--continue` — resume the most recent spec blueprint
- `--discard [slug]` — delete the most recent or matching spec
  blueprint
- `--depth <medium|high|max>` — thoroughness, default `medium`
- `--auto` — skip approval gates, used by `/skill:vibe`

## Blueprint

Create specs with:

```bash
file=$(blueprint create spec "<topic>" --status spec_review --depth <level>)
```

Expected body:

```markdown
## Research Notes

<validated current-state notes, paths, constraints>

## Spec

### Problem
### Recommendation
### Architecture Context
### Risks
### Challenges

## Plan

**Phase 1: <name>**
- Files: <paths>
- Approach: <what changes>
- Steps:
  1. <action, path, done signal>
- Verify: <command or manual check>
```

Use frontmatter status for progress:

- `spec_review` — spec drafted
- `spec_approved` — spec accepted
- `plan_review` — plan drafted
- `approved` — ready for `/skill:implement`

Run `blueprint commit spec <slug>` after every blueprint write or
status change. If it fails, stop and show the error.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve Work

- `--discard`: find via `blueprint find --type spec [--match <slug>]`,
  delete it, run `blueprint commit spec <slug>`, report.
- `--continue`: find the latest spec via `blueprint find --type spec`,
  read it, resume from its frontmatter status.
- New topic: parse flags, derive topic text, create a new spec
  blueprint.

### 2. Research

Use targeted `bash`/`read` calls. Do not dump broad files or logs.

Depth guidance:

- `medium`: key files and architecture, 3-5 phases
- `high`: all relevant files, 2-level call chains, line refs, 5-7
  phases
- `max`: exhaustive affected modules, dependency graph, annotated
  snippets, 7+ phases

Research output must include:

- Current behavior and relevant file paths
- Existing patterns to preserve
- Constraints, risks, and edge cases
- Candidate implementation approach
- Verification commands or checks

Spot-check at least three architectural claims against source before
writing the spec.

### 3. Write Spec

Write a timeless target-state spec:

- **Problem** — current gap or failure
- **Recommendation** — target behavior in present tense; no transition
  verbs like "add" or "replace"
- **Architecture Context** — target module roles and interactions
- **Risks** — edge cases, failure modes, constraints
- **Challenges** — 1-3 devil's-advocate concerns, or "None"

Set status to `spec_review`. If `--auto` is absent, present the spec
and stop for approval.

### 4. Write Plan

After spec approval, write a phased plan. Every phase must include:

- Files to read/modify/create
- Approach
- Ordered steps
- Done signal
- Verification

Set status to `plan_review`. If `--auto` is absent, present the plan
and stop for approval.

### 5. Approve

When plan is accepted, set status to `approved`, commit the blueprint,
and report:

```text
Plan: <path>
Next: /skill:implement
```

## Output

Keep user-facing output concise:

```text
Spec/Plan: <path>
Status: <status>
Next: /skill:implement
```
